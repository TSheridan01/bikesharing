## The purpose of this project was to create visuals from data for exploring the idea of a bike-sharing business in Des Moines. We used data from New York to highlight some key metrics for investors. 


There were over 2.3 million rides for the in August 2019. 81% of the users were bike share program subscirbers; while 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females. Younger users tend to use the service for longer rides while elder riders used it for shorter distances and durations. 

Data from Des Moines shows that there are 215,408 residents in Des Moines, with a median age of 34. Of this, 49.13% are males and 50.87% are females. This shows that they will not have the same volume as NYC but they do have a younger population with a less dense city which makes biking an attractive form of transportation.
